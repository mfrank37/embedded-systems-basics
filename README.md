# Embedded systems basics

Basic examples of embedded systems. Each lab folder has details in it's `README.md` for reference.

## Prerequisites

- Proteus (simulation software)
- [Microchip Studio](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/microchip-studio)
- C programming basics
- Basic Electronic Circuit knowledge

## Instructions

- Open a specific lab in a file explorer, usually have software project folder and hardware/circuit project folder.
- Open the software project with Microchip studio (`.atsln` extension)
- Open the hardware/circuit simulation program (Proteus)
- Link the Microcontroller in circuit to the compiled software program. Usually in `{Software folder}/Debug/` the `{app-name}.hex` file.
- Run the simulation

***In some cases you don't need to link, It may be already linked and just simulates***
